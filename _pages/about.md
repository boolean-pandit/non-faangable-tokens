Ahoy! I'm a machine learning engineer who's both puzzled by and curious about the ever growing list of things one must know well to interview at the ~~FAANG~~ ~~MAANG~~ MANGA (?) :thinking: companies. I enjoy solving problems and figured I could document my progress in this blog. If you find something useful, or feel something is missing, drop a note :)
