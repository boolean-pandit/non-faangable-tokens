    "Binary search is useful for searching through a set of values (which typically are sorted) efficiently. At each step, it reduces the search space by half, thereby running in $O(log(n))$ complexity. While it sounds simple enough to understand, it is deceptively tricky to implement and use in problems. Over the next few sections, let's take a look at binary search and it can be applied to some commonly encountered interview problems."

    "# A Recipe for Binary Searching\n",
    "How does binary search reduce the search space by half? It leverages the fact that the input is sorted (_most of the time_) and compares the middle value of the search space at any step with the target value that we're searching for. If the middle value is smaller than the target, then we know that the target can only lie to its right, thus eliminating all the values to the left of the middle value and vice versa. So what information do we need to implement binary search?\n",

    "# Naïve Binary Search Problems\n",
    "Here's a list of problems that can be solved using vanilla binary search (or slightly modifying it). Anytime you see a problem statement which goes something like _\"Given a sorted list..\"_ or _\"Find the position of an element\"_, think of using binary search. You can also consider **sorting** the input in case it is an unordered collection of items to reduce it to a binary search problem. Note that this list is by no means exhaustive, but is a good starting point to practice binary search:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the problems above, we can either directly apply binary search or adapt it slightly to solve the problem. For example, take the square root problem. We know that the square root of a positive number $n$ has to lie between $[1, n / 2]$. This gives us the bounds for the search space. Applying binary search over this space allows us to find the a good approximation of the square root. See the implementation below for details:"
