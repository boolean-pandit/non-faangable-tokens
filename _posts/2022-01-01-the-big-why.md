# A Ramble-free Preamble

## The Why

There are a dime a dozen blogs, repositories, courses, yada yada on interviews. Why do we need yet another one released into the internet ether? The answer is that we don't, but rather, I do. In this wonderful [post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), fast.ai co-founder [Dr. Rachel Thomas](https://www.fast.ai/about/) explains the key benefits of having your own blog. Personally, I would like to get a deeper understanding of what I'm writing about and in the process, improve my technical writing. Additionally, my hope is that some of what I write helps folks who are at the same level as I currently am (A Padawan, newbie, *insert your nickname here*) and those who are aspiring to do better at this interviewing game. Eventually, I hope this blog becomes a reference point for me to return to and revisit things that need to be refreshed in memory.

## The What
This is in no way aimed at being a comprehensive compendium for all things interviewing [^1]. I will focus on interesting coding problems, topics in system design and machine learning (used very loosely here :wink: ). In an interview setting, it's pretty likely that you'll face a problem or question which you've not encountered before (unless you're into the obsessive and tiring leetcode grind [^2], DDIA grind [^3], etc., etc.). So, instead of trying to memorize everything you possibly can and hope for the best, why not try to build a solution from first principles and identify interesting patterns in the process? Furthermore, you have the best part of 40 minutes during the interview (excluding the hellos and byes and the *"do you have any questions for me?"* sections). What's crucial is that you communicate clearly, and show your thought process, working collaboratively with your interviewer (usually, this is possible). 
	
## The How
That's exactly what I'll attempt to do here. Write about problems and solutions from first principles. Over the course of these posts, I'm curious to see what kinds of patterns and challenges emerge. For coding (a.k.a Data Structure & Algorithm) questions, I'll curate problems from a variety of topics and where possible, suggest *similar* problems. For system design, I'll mixup concept deep dives along with problems that have been rumored to appear in actual interviews at some of these companies. For machine learning, I'll look at interesting papers and some problems (both implementation and system design ones :smile: ). 


With all this out of the way, Let's get started!
